# Ping-Pong-Game-using-Java
This project is a 2D Ping Pong Game developed using Java and JavaFX. It offers a fun, interactive gaming experience and demonstrates core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, GUI design, and basic animation in Java.

# Game Features:
  🎯 Single Player Mode against a basic AI
  🕹️ Smooth paddle control using keyboard input
  💡 Score tracking for both player and opponent
  ⚡ Real-time collision detection between the ball and paddles/walls
  🎨 Simple and intuitive UI using JavaFX

# Technologies Used:
  1) Java – Core programming logic and game engine
  2) JavaFX – For building the GUI and handling animations
